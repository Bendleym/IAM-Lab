# 🔐 IAM Privilege Audit & Automation Lab

### 🧩 Overview
This project simulates an enterprise **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** environment using **Active Directory** and **PowerShell**.  
It showcases how organizations audit user privileges, enforce least privilege, and automate access reviews.
