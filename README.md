# IAM Privilege Audit & Automation Lab

### Overview
This project simulates an enterprise **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** environment built in VirtualBox using **Windows Server 2019** and **Windows 10 Pro**.  
It demonstrates how organizations audit privileges, enforce least privilege, and automate access reviews using **Active Directory** and **PowerShell**.

---

### Architecture
- **Domain Controller (DC01):** Windows Server 2019 running Active Directory Domain Services  
- **Client Workstation (CLIENT01):** Windows 10 Pro joined to the domain  
- **Tools Used:** Active Directory Users & Computers, Group Policy, PowerShell, Event Viewer  

---

### Key Highlights
- Created a simulated AD domain and joined user endpoints  
- Conducted privilege audits for user, group, and admin accounts  
- Automated user access reviews and least-privilege enforcement with PowerShell  
- Documented IAM controls for provisioning, MFA, and access recertification aligned with **NIST 800-53** and **CIS** standards

### Sample Deliverables
- Access Control Policy  
- Privilege Audit Report  
- User Provisioning Checklist  
- PowerShell automation scripts for account auditing  

---

### Next Steps
- Integrate **Azure AD** and conditional access for hybrid IAM simulation  
- Add **compliance mapping** to NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 Annex A controls
